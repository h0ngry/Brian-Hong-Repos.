This game is going to be a very simple turn-based game in which the player 
chooses their type of fighter that they want to fight with. This includes a 
Warrior, Archer, or Mage classes. The whole point of the game is to 
engage various enemies in a row. Since, I am starting with simple concepts
, the game is going to look like this:


"Which class do you want to be? Press 1 to be a Warrior. Press 2 to be an Archer. Press 3 to be a mage."
1

You encounter an enemy is it is of the ranged class. You engage.

A dice is rolled to see who attacks first. You roll a 6. The enemy rolls a 8.

Eight is higher, so the enemy attacks first.

The enemy deals 2 damage, you have (x) health left.

.....

The two sides lock into combat until one side runs out of hitpoints.

The player needs to stay alive as long as possible by winning the chains
of encounters and kept as score (one point for winning each encounter).

The damage dealt will be a random number within a range.
